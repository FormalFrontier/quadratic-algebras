# Integral closure of squarefree quadratic algebras

A domain quadratic algebra `A[ω]` with `ω² = f` is integrally closed when
`A` is a unique factorization domain, `f` is squarefree, and `2` is
invertible.  The proof transports an integral element of the total fraction
ring to the coordinate model over `FractionRing A`.  Its trace and norm
descend to `A`; the trace recovers the constant coordinate, and squarefree
denominator descent recovers the linear coordinate.
